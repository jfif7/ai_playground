description: Phase 3 - TDD Implementation Loop (Run this for ONE use case at a time)
---

> **Note:** Consult the `document_management` skill for file naming and organization rules.

**Input Needed:** Tell me which Use Case file to implement (e.g., `docs/specs/uc_01.md`).

1. [ ] **Test Planning**
   - Read the specific Use Case file.
   - Create a new test file (e.g., `tests/test_use_case_01.py`).

2. [ ] **Red Phase (Write Test)**
   - Write a failing test that covers the requirements in the Use Case.
   - Run the test to confirm it fails.

3. [ ] **Green Phase (Implementation)**
   - Write the minimum code to pass the test.
   - Run the test to confirm it passes.

4. [ ] **Refactor & Verify**
   - Clean up the code.
   - Ensure all tests pass.
   - Update `docs/walkthrough.md` with progress.
